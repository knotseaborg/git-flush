# Git Flush: *Toilet humor for struggling devs*
`git-flush` is equivalent to `git commit`, but it "flushes" git commits with poop-themed roasts 😢. Here's what it looks like! 💨
| My commit content  | What *OpenAI GPT-4.1-nano* thinks about it 💩                  | My Rating |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| wrote a fancy logger | Your logger's so fancy it clears out the sewer—making even shit look like a decorated turd.         | ⭐   |
| funky code? | Your code's more clogged than a sewer—time to flush that commit! | ⭐⭐   |
| tiny, pathetic diff  | This diff’s so empty, even your imaginary poop joke has nothing to flush!     | ⭐⭐⭐   |

> No need for humans to call your code crap—we’ve got you covered! 😤

## 💩 Requirements
- `go 1.24.5`: Builds this poopie CLI tool.
- `git`: For all the usual commit plumbing.
- `vi` (macOS/Linux) or `notepad` (Windows): To edit the config without making a mess.

## 🚿 Setup
1. Clone this repo—don’t let it stink up your drive!
2. Run `go build -o git-flush main.go` in the root to unclog the binary.
3. Toss `git-flush` into your `PATH`—let it flow!
4. Tweak the config with `git-flush --config` using `vi` or `notepad`. No splashback!💦

## 🪠 Usage
Do your usual `git` stuff, but swap `git commit` for `git-flush`. Watch your code get roasted as it swirls down the drain! 😌

## 🚽 Inspiration
*Better Call Saul* and *Borderlands* collide in `git-flush`, a love letter to code and crap jokes. Why? Because coding’s too serious, and nothing screams “fun” like a toilet-flushing commit roasted by a snarky robot or a sleazy lawyer!
